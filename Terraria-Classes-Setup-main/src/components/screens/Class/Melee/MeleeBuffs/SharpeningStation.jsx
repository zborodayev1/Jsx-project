        <h1><a className='font-bold'>The Sharpening Station</a> is a furniture item found naturally <a className='font-bold'>generated in Underground Cabins in the Underground Jungle</a>. In Hardmode, it is also sold by the Merchant for 10 gold.

Placing and pressing Open / Activate on the Sharpening Station grants the Sharpened buff, which increases armor penetration while holding a melee weapon by 12. This lasts until the player dies or leaves the world, but can be canceled at any time by right-clicking the icon (Desktop version), by selecting the icon using Cycle Next/Previous Buff and then pressing Remove Buff (Console version), or by double-tapping the buff icon (Mobile version).

Unlike equipment buff items, the Sharpening Station must be placed in order to activate the buff. It can be mined with a pickaxe or drill and picked up again, even while the buff is active, which will not cancel the buff. Placement is only dependent on an adequate space of 3Ã—2 tiles being available.</h1>
