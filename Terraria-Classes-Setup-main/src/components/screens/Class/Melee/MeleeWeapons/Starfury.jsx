        <h1><a className='font-bold'>The Starfury</a> is a pre-Hardmode sword which occasionally summons a star projectile from the sky to the location of the cursor when swung, and costs no ammunition or mana. The star emits light, deals 1.5Ã— the swords damage (37 base damage) but no knockback. The star can pierce up to 1 target, hitting a total of 2 targets. The star will travel through all blocks until it reaches the lowest empty space at or above the players cursor, after which it will break on the next block it hits. The Starfury has a  1/4 (25%) chance of being found inside Skyware Chests on Floating Islands, as well as a 1/4 (25%) chance of being obtained from Sky Crates and Azure Crates.Its best modifier is Legendary.</h1>
