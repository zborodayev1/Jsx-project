        <h1>The Ice Sickle is a Hardmode sword that fires a spinning blue sickle projectile with no ammunition or mana cost. The projectile will gradually reduce speed and eventually stop in midair, exist up to 5 seconds before disappearing, and pierce a limited number of targets. The Ice Sickle can be dropped by Armored Vikings, Ice Elementals, Ice Tortoises, and Icy Mermen, which spawn in the Snow and Ice biomes.</h1>
